# **App Name**: RealTimeViz

## Core Features:

- Web Serial Connection: Establish a real-time serial connection with the Arduino board via the Web Serial API.
- Data Reception: Receive numerical sensor data transmitted from the Arduino over the serial connection.
- Live Chart Visualization: Display the incoming sensor data as a dynamically updating line chart in real-time.
- AI Chart Enhancement Tool: Utilize an AI tool that suggests contextually appropriate chart titles and color schemes based on a user description of the data.
- Fan Control: Allow users to control fans connected to the Arduino board via the web interface.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to evoke trust and reliability in the data representation.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) to provide a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#FF9800) to highlight interactive elements and important data points.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to create a tech-forward feel.
- Use clear, simple icons to represent different data types or settings.
- Emphasize data clarity and readability with ample white space and a grid-based structure.
- Use subtle animations to smoothly update the chart and provide a sense of live data flow.
